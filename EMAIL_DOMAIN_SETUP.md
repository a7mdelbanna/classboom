# Email Domain Setup Status

## 🚨 Current Issue
The email invitations were failing because we were using an unverified domain (`noreply@classboom.vercel.app`) with Resend.

## ✅ Temporary Fix Applied
- Updated Edge Function to use `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's pre-verified test domain)
- This ensures emails will be delivered immediately

## 📧 What This Means
- Emails will now come from "ClassBoom <onboarding@resend.dev>"
- They should arrive in your inbox (check spam if not in primary)
- All invitation functionality will work

## 🎯 For Production Setup

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain with Resend
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your production domain (e.g., classboom.com)
3. Add the DNS records Resend provides:
   - SPF record
   - DKIM record
   - Optional: DMARC record
4. Wait for verification (usually < 24 hours)
5. Update Edge Function to use your domain

### Option 2: Use a Subdomain
1. Create a subdomain like `mail.classboom.com`
2. Verify it with Resend
3. Use `noreply@mail.classboom.com` as sender

### Option 3: Continue with Resend Test Domain
- Fine for development and testing
- Emails clearly marked as from ClassBoom
- No setup required

## 📝 To Update Email Domain Later

1. Edit `/supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts`:
```typescript
const fromAddress = 'noreply@yourdomain.com' // Your verified domain
```

2. Deploy the function:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy send-email --no-verify-jwt
```

## 🔍 Testing
Try sending an invitation now - it should work! The email will come from `onboarding@resend.dev` but will have ClassBoom branding.

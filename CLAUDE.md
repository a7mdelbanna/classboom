# ClassBoom Project State - Claude Memory File

## 🚨 FIRST STEPS WHEN STARTING A NEW SESSION:

1. **Read this entire file** to understand the project
2. **Run**: `npm run claude:startup` for immediate status
3. **Check for MCP tools** (tools starting with `mcp_` or `mcp__`)
4. **The authentication system is now COMPLETE!** 🎉

## ✅ FIXED: Students Disappearing Issue (2025-07-03)

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** The app was creating duplicate schools on every auth state change/page refresh!

**The Real Problem:**
- User had **1,016 duplicate schools** created (one user had over 1000!)
- Students were scattered across different school IDs
- Each page refresh might select a different (empty) school
- Race condition in `getCurrentSchoolId` was creating new schools simultaneously

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Emergency Database Migration** (`fix_duplicate_schools_emergency_v2`)
   - Consolidated all duplicate schools to the oldest one per user
   - Deleted 1,255 duplicate schools across all users
   - Added UNIQUE constraint on schools.owner_id to prevent future duplicates
2. **Updated `getCurrentSchoolId`** with race condition protection
   - Always uses the OLDEST school (prevents duplicates)
   - Handles unique constraint violations gracefully
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
3. **Migration SQL**: `supabase/fix-duplicate-schools-emergency.sql`

**To verify the fix:**
- Run the app - students should now be visible!
- Check console: should show "Using existing school" not "Creating school"
- Only 1 school per user exists (enforced by database constraint)
- Test student created successfully after fix

## Project Overview
**ClassBoom** is a revolutionary School Management SaaS platform built with:
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v3, Framer Motion
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS-based multi-tenancy)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with email verification
- Routing: React Router v6

## 🎉 LATEST UPDATE (2025-07-03 @ 23:45): COMPLETE STUDENT & PARENT PORTAL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED!

### 🚨 **IMPORTANT: TEST FIRST BEFORE PROCEEDING!**

Before doing anything else, please test the new portal invitation system:

1. **Start the app**: Already running on http://localhost:5174/
2. **Log into your school admin account**
3. **Go to Students → Find "John Doe (TEST001)"** (test student created)
4. **Click on John Doe to view his profile**
5. **Test the Portal Access features**:
   - Try sending a student portal invitation
   - Try sending parent portal invitations (auto-populated from parent info)
   - Check email logs in browser console
6. **Test activation flow** (optional):
   - Copy invitation links from console
   - Try activating accounts
   - Test token validation

**What to look for:**
- Portal Access Card shows proper status
- Parent Invite Card shows existing parent info
- Email templates log correctly to console
- No JavaScript errors in console
- UI components render properly

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) based
   - All schools share public schema with RLS policies
   - Complete data isolation via `school_id` filtering
   - Supabase-compatible architecture
   - schema_name column defaults to 'public' (no UNIQUE constraint)

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Email verification required (Supabase setting)
   - School owners create account → automatic school record creation
   - StudentService handles school creation with multiple fallback layers
   - schema_name is NOT passed during school creation (uses default)

3. **Tech Stack Choices**:
   - Tailwind CSS v3 (downgraded from v4 for stability)
   - React Router v6 for routing
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - Supabase for backend (no custom API needed)

---

**REMEMBER**: ClassBoom is a premium SaaS product. Every interaction should feel delightful! 🚀

## 🎨 UI/UX Requirements (IMPORTANT - Apply to entire app!)
- **NO DEFAULT BROWSER ALERTS**: Always use the custom Toast component from `useToast()` for notifications
- **All dialogs/modals**: Must be custom-styled with animations, never use browser defaults
- **Form controls**: Use custom components (CustomSelect, CustomCheckbox) for consistent styling
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion for all transitions and interactions
- **Error handling**: Show errors using Toast notifications, not console logs or alerts
- **Dropdowns**: Must have proper z-index to appear above other content

### 🎯 Core UI Patterns (See UI_UX_RULES.md for full details):
1. **Clickable Cards**: All entity cards (students, courses, etc.) must be fully clickable
   - Entire card opens edit modal with `cursor-pointer` and `scale: 1.02` on hover
   - Nested buttons must use `e.stopPropagation()`
2. **Modal Click-Outside**: All modals must close when clicking the backdrop
   - Use Modal component with `closeOnBackdropClick={true}` (default)
   - Custom modals need backdrop onClick handler with content stopPropagation
3. **Visual Feedback**: Consistent hover states, transitions (200-300ms), and loading states
4. **Dark Mode**: All inputs use `dark:bg-gray-700`, not `dark:bg-gray-800`
- **🌓 DARK THEME SUPPORT**: Every component MUST support both light and dark themes

## 🌓 Dark Theme Styling Guidelines (CRITICAL - Apply to ALL components!)
When creating or updating any component, ALWAYS include proper dark theme support:

### Input Fields & Form Controls:
```tsx
className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange-500 focus:border-transparent bg-white dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-900 dark:text-white placeholder-gray-400 dark:placeholder-gray-500"
```

### Labels:
```tsx
className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-1"
```

### Headings:
```tsx
className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white"
```

### Custom Components (CustomSelect, MultiSelect, DatePicker):
- Background: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700` (NOT dark:bg-gray-800)
- Text: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- Border: `border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600`
- Placeholder: `text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`
- Dropdown backgrounds: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700`

### Cards & Containers:
```tsx
className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-700"
```

### Key Rules:
1. **NEVER use dark:bg-gray-800 for input fields** - Use dark:bg-gray-700 for consistency
2. **Always include text color classes** - dark:text-white for inputs, dark:text-gray-300 for labels
3. **Include placeholder colors** - dark:placeholder-gray-500
4. **Test in both themes** - Toggle between light and dark to ensure readability
5. **Custom components must match** - All custom dropdowns/selects use same dark:bg-gray-700 as inputs

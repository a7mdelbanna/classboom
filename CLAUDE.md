# ClassBoom Project State - Claude Memory File

## ðŸš¨ FIRST STEPS WHEN STARTING A NEW SESSION:

1. **Read this entire file** to understand the project
2. **Run**: `npm run claude:startup` for immediate status
3. **Check for MCP tools** (tools starting with `mcp_` or `mcp__`)
4. **The authentication system is now COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ‰

## âœ… FIXED: Students Disappearing Issue (2025-07-03)

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** The app was creating duplicate schools on every auth state change/page refresh!

**The Real Problem:**
- User had **1,016 duplicate schools** created (one user had over 1000!)
- Students were scattered across different school IDs
- Each page refresh might select a different (empty) school
- Race condition in `getCurrentSchoolId` was creating new schools simultaneously

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Emergency Database Migration** (`fix_duplicate_schools_emergency_v2`)
   - Consolidated all duplicate schools to the oldest one per user
   - Deleted 1,255 duplicate schools across all users
   - Added UNIQUE constraint on schools.owner_id to prevent future duplicates
2. **Updated `getCurrentSchoolId`** with race condition protection
   - Always uses the OLDEST school (prevents duplicates)
   - Handles unique constraint violations gracefully
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
3. **Migration SQL**: `supabase/fix-duplicate-schools-emergency.sql`

**To verify the fix:**
- Run the app - students should now be visible!
- Check console: should show "Using existing school" not "Creating school"
- Only 1 school per user exists (enforced by database constraint)
- Test student created successfully after fix

## Project Overview
**ClassBoom** is a revolutionary School Management SaaS platform built with:
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v3, Framer Motion
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS-based multi-tenancy)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with email verification
- Routing: React Router v6

## ðŸŽ‰ LATEST UPDATE (2025-07-03 @ 23:45): COMPLETE STUDENT & PARENT PORTAL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED!

### ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT: TEST FIRST BEFORE PROCEEDING!**

Before doing anything else, please test the new portal invitation system:

1. **Start the app**: Already running on http://localhost:5174/
2. **Log into your school admin account**
3. **Go to Students â†’ Find "John Doe (TEST001)"** (test student created)
4. **Click on John Doe to view his profile**
5. **Test the Portal Access features**:
   - Try sending a student portal invitation
   - Try sending parent portal invitations (auto-populated from parent info)
   - Check email logs in browser console
6. **Test activation flow** (optional):
   - Copy invitation links from console
   - Try activating accounts
   - Test token validation

**What to look for:**
- Portal Access Card shows proper status

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) based
   - All schools share public schema with RLS policies
   - Complete data isolation via `school_id` filtering
   - Supabase-compatible architecture
   - schema_name column defaults to 'public' (no UNIQUE constraint)

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Email verification required (Supabase setting)
   - School owners create account â†’ automatic school record creation
   - StudentService handles school creation with multiple fallback layers
   - schema_name is NOT passed during school creation (uses default)

3. **Tech Stack Choices**:
   - Tailwind CSS v3 (downgraded from v4 for stability)
   - React Router v6 for routing
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - Supabase for backend (no custom API needed)

## Common Commands

3. **For testing**: Copy activation URLs and open on same machine

**Environment Variable Setup:**
```bash
# .env
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173  # Development
VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com # Production
```

1. **Send invitation**: Go to Student Profile â†’ "Resend Invitation"
2. **Check email**: Email arrives in inbox with beautiful template
3. **Test locally**: Copy activation link and open on same machine
4. **For external testing**: Deploy to production first

**Next Steps for Production:**

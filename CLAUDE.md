# ClassBoom Project State - Claude Memory File

## 🚨 FIRST STEPS WHEN STARTING A NEW SESSION:

1. **Read this entire file** to understand the project
2. **Run**: `npm run claude:startup` for immediate status
3. **Check for MCP tools** (tools starting with `mcp_` or `mcp__`)
4. **The authentication system is now COMPLETE!** 🎉

## 🚨 CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED: RLS Policy Disaster (2025-07-06)

**NEVER ADD RLS POLICIES WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION!**

## 🚨 CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED: Database Function Dependencies (2025-07-06)

**ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING FUNCTIONS BEFORE MAKING DATABASE CHANGES!**

**What went wrong:**
- Added new portal columns to students table
- Created new RPC functions for student activation
- BUT FORGOT that student creation depends on `generate_student_code` function
- This function didn't exist in the database, breaking ALL student creation
- The app was calling a non-existent function, causing 404 errors

**The MANDATORY process before ANY database changes:**

1. **FIRST**: Search codebase for ALL functions being used:
   ```bash
   grep -r "\.rpc(" src/
   grep -r "generate_" src/
   ```

2. **VERIFY**: Check if functions exist in database before adding new ones

3. **TEST**: Always test existing functionality after schema changes

4. **CREATE MISSING FUNCTIONS**: If code expects a function, create it FIRST

**The missing function that broke everything:**
```sql
-- This function was missing and broke student creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_student_code(p_school_id uuid)
RETURNS varchar AS $$
-- Function body here
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**New Rule: NEVER make database changes without:**
1. Reading ALL existing code that might be affected
2. Checking which RPC functions the code expects to exist
3. Creating missing functions BEFORE testing
4. Testing ALL existing flows after any database change

## 🚨 CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED: Student Portal Database Schema Issues (2025-07-06)

**ALWAYS VERIFY DATABASE COLUMN EXISTENCE BEFORE CREATING RPC FUNCTIONS!**

**What went catastrophically wrong:**
- Created RPC function `get_student_with_school` with columns that don't exist
- Referenced `s.gender` - column doesn't exist in students table  
- Referenced `sch.logo_url` - column doesn't exist in schools table
- Referenced `sch.address` - column doesn't exist in schools table
- Each time we "fixed" one column, another non-existent column broke the function
- Student portal completely broken with "Student Profile Not Found" error

**The SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING APPROACH that FINALLY worked:**

1. **Read the error logs carefully**: 
   ```
   RPC error: {code: '42703', details: null, hint: 'Perhaps you meant to reference the column "s.grade".', message: 'column s.gender does not exist'}
   ```

2. **Fix ONE column at a time**:
   - First: Removed `s.gender` column reference
   - Second: Removed `sch.logo_url` column reference  
   - Third: Removed `sch.address`, `sch.phone`, `sch.email` references
   - Final: Kept only `sch.name` which definitely exists

3. **DROP and RECREATE function** when changing return type:
   ```sql
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_student_with_school(uuid);
   -- Then recreate with correct columns
   ```

4. **Understand the REAL problem**: Students were calling `getCurrentSchoolId()` which is for SCHOOL OWNERS, not students!

**The CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT:**
- **School Owners**: Use `getCurrentSchoolId()` to find their owned schools
- **Students**: Should ONLY use RPC functions, never query schools as owners
- **Different user types need different data access patterns**

**The WORKING SOLUTION:**
```sql
-- Minimal RPC function with ONLY existing columns
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_student_with_school(p_user_id uuid)
RETURNS TABLE (
  -- Only include columns that 100% exist
  id uuid,
  student_code text,
  first_name text,
  last_name text,
  email text,
  phone text,
  date_of_birth date,
  school_id uuid,
  user_id uuid,
  can_login boolean,
  account_created_at timestamptz,
  grade text,
  skill_level text,
  notes text,
  avatar_url text,
  created_at timestamptz,
  school_name text  -- ONLY school field that exists
) 
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 
    s.id, s.student_code, s.first_name, s.last_name,
    s.email, s.phone, s.date_of_birth, s.school_id,
    s.user_id, s.can_login, s.account_created_at,
    s.grade, s.skill_level, s.notes, s.avatar_url,
    s.created_at,
    sch.name as school_name  -- ONLY school field
  FROM public.students s
  LEFT JOIN public.schools sch ON sch.id = s.school_id
  WHERE s.user_id = p_user_id AND s.can_login = true;
END;
$$;
```

**The MANDATORY CHECKLIST for RPC functions:**

1. **NEVER ASSUME COLUMNS EXIST** - Always verify in database first
2. **Start with MINIMAL columns** - Add only what you KNOW exists
3. **Test each column addition** - Don't add multiple unknown columns at once
4. **Use proper user access patterns**:
   - School owners: Direct table queries with `getCurrentSchoolId()`
   - Students: RPC functions with `user_id` parameter
   - Staff: RPC functions with `user_id` parameter
5. **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you exactly which column is missing
6. **DROP and RECREATE** when changing function signatures

**NEVER DO THIS AGAIN:**
- Don't copy-paste RPC functions without verifying column existence
- Don't mix user access patterns (students calling school owner methods)
- Don't ignore column existence errors and keep adding more columns
- Don't assume schema consistency across all tables

**What went catastrophically wrong:**
- While trying to fix staff portal activation, I added new RLS policies
- These policies BROKE THE ENTIRE APP's data retrieval
- Students count showed 0, courses wouldn't load, staff data disappeared
- Activities stopped showing, EVERYTHING was broken
- The app became completely unusable

**The terrible approach that broke everything:**
```sql
-- DON'T EVER DO THIS! These policies broke the entire app:
CREATE POLICY "Staff can view their own record" ON public.staff FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Staff can read their school" ON public.schools FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (id IN (SELECT school_id FROM public.staff WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous to read staff for activation" ON public.staff;
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous to read schools for staff activation" ON public.schools;
```

**Why it was a disaster:**
1. Added restrictive policies without understanding existing RLS setup
2. Changed authentication check order in AuthContext (moved staff before school owner)
3. Modified working authentication flow without proper testing
4. Created policies that conflicted with existing multi-tenant architecture
5. The policies were too restrictive and prevented legitimate data access

**What I learned - NEVER DO THIS AGAIN:**
1. NEVER add RLS policies without fully understanding existing setup
2. NEVER change authentication check order when it's working
3. NEVER modify `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` across the board
4. Test in isolation before applying database-level changes
5. RLS policies can completely break an app - treat them with extreme caution

**The fix that saved the app:**
```sql
-- Had to emergency remove all the problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous to read staff for activation" ON public.staff;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous to read schools for staff activation" ON public.schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can view their own record" ON public.staff;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can update their own record" ON public.staff;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can read their school" ON public.schools;
```

## ✅ FIXED: Staff Email Invitation Issue (2025-07-05)

**This fix was successful and didn't break anything:**
- Updated Edge Function for Resend v3 API
- Fixed email service response handling
- Added visual invitation status indicators
- ✅ Staff invitation emails now send successfully

## ✅ FIXED: Students Disappearing Issue (2025-07-03)

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** The app was creating duplicate schools on every auth state change/page refresh!

**The Real Problem:**
- User had **1,016 duplicate schools** created (one user had over 1000!)
- Students were scattered across different school IDs
- Each page refresh might select a different (empty) school
- Race condition in `getCurrentSchoolId` was creating new schools simultaneously

**Fix Applied:**
1. **Emergency Database Migration** (`fix_duplicate_schools_emergency_v2`)
   - Consolidated all duplicate schools to the oldest one per user
   - Deleted 1,255 duplicate schools across all users
   - Added UNIQUE constraint on schools.owner_id to prevent future duplicates
2. **Updated `getCurrentSchoolId`** with race condition protection
   - Always uses the OLDEST school (prevents duplicates)
   - Handles unique constraint violations gracefully
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
3. **Migration SQL**: `supabase/fix-duplicate-schools-emergency.sql`

**To verify the fix:**
- Run the app - students should now be visible!
- Check console: should show "Using existing school" not "Creating school"
- Only 1 school per user exists (enforced by database constraint)
- Test student created successfully after fix

   - Account activated with proper permissions
   - Automatic user metadata assignment with student_id

3. **Role-Based Login** ✅
   - Enhanced login page with role selection
   - **CRITICAL**: Role validation prevents unauthorized access
   - Students must select "Student" role to access portal
   - Clear error messages for role mismatches
   - Automatic logout if wrong role selected

   - Student details (ID, grade, skill level)
   - School information display
   - Avatar support with fallback initials
   - Quick action buttons for future features
   - Logout button in header
   - Dark mode support

### 🔧 **STUDENT PORTAL TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

**Safe RPC Function for Students:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_student_with_school(p_user_id uuid)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid, student_code text, first_name text, last_name text,
  email text, phone text, date_of_birth date, school_id uuid,
  user_id uuid, can_login boolean, account_created_at timestamptz,
  grade text, skill_level text, notes text, avatar_url text,
  created_at timestamptz, school_name text
) 
LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT s.id, s.student_code, s.first_name, s.last_name,
         s.email, s.phone, s.date_of_birth, s.school_id,
         s.user_id, s.can_login, s.account_created_at,
         s.grade, s.skill_level, s.notes, s.avatar_url,
         s.created_at, sch.name as school_name
  FROM public.students s
  LEFT JOIN public.schools sch ON sch.id = s.school_id
  WHERE s.user_id = p_user_id AND s.can_login = true;
END;
$$;
```

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- Students use ONLY RPC functions, never `getCurrentSchoolId()`
- School owners use `getCurrentSchoolId()` for their owned schools
- Different user types have different data access patterns
- Simple RLS policies with only current table references

## 🎉 PREVIOUS UPDATE (2025-07-06 @ 02:30): COMPLETE STAFF PORTAL SYSTEM WORKING!

### ✅ **STAFF PORTAL FULLY OPERATIONAL**

The entire staff portal system is now working end-to-end with all features:

1. **Staff Invitations** ✅
   - Email invitations sent successfully via Resend API
   - Professional HTML email templates
   - 48-hour expiration with visual countdown
   - Invitation status tracking (sent/expired/active)

2. **Account Activation** ✅
   - Staff click activation link from email
   - Set their password securely
   - Account activated with proper permissions
   - Automatic role assignment based on staff record

3. **Role-Based Login** ✅
   - Enhanced login page with role selection
   - **CRITICAL**: Role validation prevents unauthorized access
   - Users must select correct role matching their account type
   - Clear error messages for role mismatches
   - Automatic logout if wrong role selected

4. **Staff Portal Dashboard** ✅
   - Professional dashboard with personal information
   - Employment details and compensation display
   - Role-based quick actions
   - Logout button in header
   - Dark mode support

### 🔐 **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Login Role Validation**

**Problem Fixed**: Users could login through any role option regardless of actual role
**Solution**: Created role validation system that:
- Validates user's actual role after authentication
- Automatically signs out users with wrong role selection
- Shows clear error messages
- Added help text for each role option

### 🚨 **RLS POLICY APPROACH THAT WORKS**

**NEVER DO THIS (causes infinite recursion):**
```sql
-- BAD: References other tables in RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Staff can read their school" ON public.schools 
USING (id IN (SELECT school_id FROM public.staff WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
```

**ALWAYS DO THIS (safe approach):**
```sql
-- GOOD: Simple policies that only reference current table
CREATE POLICY "Staff can read own record by user_id" ON public.staff 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND portal_access_enabled = true);

-- GOOD: Use RPC functions for complex queries
CREATE FUNCTION get_staff_with_school(p_user_id uuid)
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$ ... $$;
```

**Key Lessons:**
1. Keep RLS policies simple - only reference the current table
2. Use RPC functions with SECURITY DEFINER for complex queries
3. Never create circular dependencies between table policies
4. Test RLS changes in isolation before applying

### 🔐 **STAFF AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS**

The staff portal authentication has been significantly enhanced with proper role management and permissions:

1. **Enhanced AuthContext**:
   - ✅ Added `staffInfo` state with complete staff data including permissions
   - ✅ Stores staff role (teacher, manager, admin, support, custodian)
   - ✅ Includes permissions object for role-based access control
   - ✅ Default permissions automatically assigned based on role

2. **Role-Based Permissions System**:
   - ✅ **Admin**: Full access to all features (can manage staff, view finances)
   - ✅ **Manager**: Can manage students, enrollments, view finances (no staff management)
   - ✅ **Teacher**: Limited to their classes and attendance marking
   - ✅ **Support**: Read-only access to student information
   - ✅ **Custodian**: Minimal access for facility management

3. **New Features**:
   - ✅ **useStaffPermissions Hook**: Check permissions throughout the app
   - ✅ **Enhanced Login Page**: Added Staff/Teacher option to role selection
   - ✅ **Role-Based UI**: Different dashboard options based on staff role
   - ✅ **Permissions Migration**: Database field for granular access control
   - ✅ **Permission Defaults**: Automatically set on staff creation and activation

4. **SQL Migration Required**:
   ```sql
   -- Run this migration to add permissions field to staff table
   -- File: supabase/migrations/20250705120000_add_staff_permissions.sql
   ALTER TABLE public.staff ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS permissions jsonb;
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_staff_permissions ON public.staff USING gin (permissions);
   ```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) based
   - All schools share public schema with RLS policies
   - Complete data isolation via `school_id` filtering
   - Supabase-compatible architecture
   - schema_name column defaults to 'public' (no UNIQUE constraint)

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Email verification required (Supabase setting)
   - School owners create account → automatic school record creation
   - StudentService handles school creation with multiple fallback layers
   - schema_name is NOT passed during school creation (uses default)

3. **Tech Stack Choices**:
   - Tailwind CSS v3 (downgraded from v4 for stability)
   - React Router v6 for routing
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - Supabase for backend (no custom API needed)

## Common Commands

---

**REMEMBER**: ClassBoom is a premium SaaS product. Every interaction should feel delightful! 🚀

## 🎨 UI/UX Requirements (IMPORTANT - Apply to entire app!)
- **NO DEFAULT BROWSER ALERTS**: Always use the custom Toast component from `useToast()` for notifications
- **All dialogs/modals**: Must be custom-styled with animations, never use browser defaults
- **Form controls**: Use custom components (CustomSelect, CustomCheckbox) for consistent styling
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion for all transitions and interactions
- **Error handling**: Show errors using Toast notifications, not console logs or alerts
- **Dropdowns**: Must have proper z-index to appear above other content

### 🎯 Core UI Patterns (See UI_UX_RULES.md for full details):
1. **Clickable Cards**: All entity cards (students, courses, etc.) must be fully clickable
   - Entire card opens edit modal with `cursor-pointer` and `scale: 1.02` on hover
   - Nested buttons must use `e.stopPropagation()`
2. **Modal Click-Outside**: All modals must close when clicking the backdrop
   - Use Modal component with `closeOnBackdropClick={true}` (default)
   - Custom modals need backdrop onClick handler with content stopPropagation
3. **Visual Feedback**: Consistent hover states, transitions (200-300ms), and loading states
4. **Dark Mode**: All inputs use `dark:bg-gray-700`, not `dark:bg-gray-800`
- **🌓 DARK THEME SUPPORT**: Every component MUST support both light and dark themes

## 🌓 Dark Theme Styling Guidelines (CRITICAL - Apply to ALL components!)
When creating or updating any component, ALWAYS include proper dark theme support:

### Input Fields & Form Controls:
```tsx
className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600 rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange-500 focus:border-transparent bg-white dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-900 dark:text-white placeholder-gray-400 dark:placeholder-gray-500"
```

### Labels:
```tsx
className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-1"
```

### Headings:
```tsx
className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white"
```

### Custom Components (CustomSelect, MultiSelect, DatePicker):
- Background: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700` (NOT dark:bg-gray-800)
- Text: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- Border: `border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600`
- Placeholder: `text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400`
- Dropdown backgrounds: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700`

### Cards & Containers:
```tsx
className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg border border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-700"
```

### Key Rules:
1. **NEVER use dark:bg-gray-800 for input fields** - Use dark:bg-gray-700 for consistency
2. **Always include text color classes** - dark:text-white for inputs, dark:text-gray-300 for labels
3. **Include placeholder colors** - dark:placeholder-gray-500
4. **Test in both themes** - Toggle between light and dark to ensure readability
5. **Custom components must match** - All custom dropdowns/selects use same dark:bg-gray-700 as inputs

## 🛑 CRITICAL: What NOT to Do (Learned the Hard Way)

### 1. **RLS Policies - NEVER DO:**
```sql
-- ❌ NEVER reference other tables in RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Staff can read their school" ON schools 
USING (id IN (SELECT school_id FROM staff WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));

-- ❌ NEVER create circular dependencies
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous to read staff for activation" ON staff;
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous to read schools for staff activation" ON schools;
```

### 2. **RLS Policies - ALWAYS DO:**
```sql
-- ✅ Keep policies simple, reference only current table
CREATE POLICY "Staff can read own record" ON staff 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND portal_access_enabled = true);

-- ✅ Use RPC functions for complex queries
CREATE FUNCTION get_staff_with_school(p_user_id uuid)
RETURNS TABLE(...) 
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$ SELECT ... $$;
```

### 3. **Authentication - NEVER DO:**
- ❌ Don't change authentication check order in AuthContext
- ❌ Don't modify `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` without understanding impact
- ❌ Don't allow users to login through any role without validation

### 4. **Authentication - ALWAYS DO:**
- ✅ Validate user's actual role matches their login selection
- ✅ Use role validation utilities to check permissions
- ✅ Show clear error messages for role mismatches
- ✅ Automatically sign out users with wrong role selection

## 📋 Completed Successfully:

### ✅ Staff Portal System (FULLY WORKING):
1. **Email Invitations** - Sending successfully via Resend API
2. **Account Activation** - Staff can set passwords and activate accounts
3. **Role-Based Login** - Validation prevents unauthorized access
4. **Staff Dashboard** - Professional portal with logout functionality
5. **RLS Policies** - Safe implementation using RPC functions

### ✅ Key Implementations That Work:
1. **Simple RLS policies** that only reference current table
2. **RPC functions** for complex multi-table queries
3. **Role validation** on login to prevent unauthorized access
4. **Race condition handling** in activation flow
5. **Professional email templates** with proper error handling

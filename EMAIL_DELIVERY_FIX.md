# Email Delivery Fix Guide

## 🔍 Issue Found
The Edge Function was using `onboarding@resend.dev` as the sender, which might cause emails to go to spam or be filtered.

## ✅ Fix Applied
1. Updated Edge Function to use configurable sender address
2. Set environment variables for proper email configuration
3. Now using `noreply@classboom.vercel.app` as sender

## 📧 Why You Might Not See Emails

### 1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**
- Emails from new domains often go to spam
- Look for emails from "ClassBoom" or "noreply@classboom.vercel.app"

### 2. **Domain Not Verified**
- `classboom.vercel.app` is not verified with Resend
- Emails might be blocked by recipient servers

### 3. **Email Provider Filtering**
- Gmail, Outlook, etc. may filter unverified senders
- Corporate email servers have stricter rules

## 🚀 Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use Resend's Test Domain (Recommended for Testing)
```typescript
// In Edge Function
from: 'ClassBoom <onboarding@resend.dev>'
```
- This domain is pre-verified by Resend
- Better deliverability for testing

### Option 2: Test with Different Email
- Try a personal Gmail account
- Avoid corporate email addresses for testing
- Check all folders including Promotions/Updates

### Option 3: Use Email Testing Service
- Use services like [Mailinator](https://www.mailinator.com/)
- Or [TempMail](https://temp-mail.org/)
- These accept all emails without filtering

## 📋 Testing Steps

1. **Send a test invitation:**
   ```bash
   # Use the Resend Invitation button in the UI
   # Or test via API
   ```

2. **Check Resend Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/emails
   - Verify email shows as "Delivered"
   - Note the email ID for tracking

3. **Check recipient inbox:**
   - All folders (Inbox, Spam, Promotions)
   - Search for "ClassBoom" or "Sunshine"
   - Look for subject "Activate Your Student Portal"

## 🔧 For Production

Before going to production, you'll need:

1. **Custom Domain Setup**
   - Add your actual domain to Resend
   - Verify DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Update sender address to match

2. **Email Authentication**
   ```
   SPF: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   DKIM: [Provided by Resend]
   DMARC: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine;
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**
   ```bash
   # .env
   VITE_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
   
   # Edge Function Secrets
   EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```

## 📊 Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Edge Function | ✅ Deployed | Using configurable sender |
| Resend API | ✅ Working | Emails sent successfully |
| Email Delivery | ⚠️ Check Spam | Unverified domain |
| SMTP (Auth) | ❌ Not Working | Separate issue |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **For Testing:** Check spam folder or use test email service
2. **For Development:** Continue with current setup
3. **For Production:** Set up proper domain verification

**Note:** The Resend dashboard shows emails as "Delivered" which means Resend successfully handed them off to the recipient's email server. What happens after that depends on the recipient's email provider and filters.
